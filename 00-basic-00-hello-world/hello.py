introduction to programming

Mention that computers are able to do basic math and do it extremely quickly.
But it is necessary to precisely describe what exactly and how should be done.
Surprisingly many things can be done in this way - see existing programs, apps.

But sometimes there is no existing program to do what we want, in such case
someone needs to write a new program.
