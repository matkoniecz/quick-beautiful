# note also poor man's sampling profiler - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/375913/how-can-i-profile-c-code-running-on-linux/378024#378024

# tuna is a potential alternative
# Create a runtime profile with
# python3 -mcProfile -o program.prof yourfile.py
# and show it with
# tuna program.prof

# vprof has bad performance and major unfixed interface issues like https://github.com/nvdv/vprof/issues/91 or https://github.com/nvdv/vprof/issues/90
# pyflame project died. It was anyway harder to setup and run, without benefits over py-spy
# snakeviz shows blatantly wrong statistics, what was wontfixed https://github.com/jiffyclub/snakeviz/issues/112
